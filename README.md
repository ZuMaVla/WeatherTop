# WeatherTop

**WeatherTop** is a web-based software designed for meteorologists who are stationed in or travelling between various locations in Ireland. The platform allows users to collect, store, and analyse meteorological data such as weather codes, temperature, wind direction and speed, and atmospheric pressure.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login system with password verification.
- **Station Management**: Users can create and manage multiple stations, each with unique locations and meteorological reports.
- **Data Collection**: Users can manually input meteorological data, with the possibility of referencing recent data from an external service ([OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/)). This external data is optional and before submission is supposed to be reviewed/corrected as needed, based on actual measurements from the meteorological equipment at the station in question.
- **Automatic Geolocation**: Latitude and longitude are auto-populated (using [Geoapify Location Platform](https://geoapify.com)) when creating a new station, with the option to review and edit.
- **Data Visualisation**: Archived data can be visualised using simple charts.
- **Dashboard**: Provides a summary of all stations, including min/max temperature, wind speed, and pressure, along with weather code pictograms.
- **Cascade Delete**: When a station is deleted, all associated reports are removed.
- **User Profile Management**: Users can update their personal information, including name, email, and password.
